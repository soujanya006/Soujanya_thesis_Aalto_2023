Here are some papers related to Transformer architecture and high-level synthesis using Xilinx Vitis:

1. [Array-Specific Dataflow Caches for High-Level Synthesis of Memory-Intensive Algorithms on FPGAs](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3219868) by Giovanni Brignone, M. Usman Jamal, M. Lazarescu, L. Lavagno. This paper proposes an automation of the FPGA memory management in Xilinx Vitis HLS through a fully-configurable C++ source-level cache.

2. [FLOWER: A comprehensive dataflow compiler for high-level synthesis](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICFPT52863.2021.9609930) by Puya Amiri, Arsène Pérard-Gayot, Richard Membarth, P. Slusallek, Roland Leißa, Sebastian Hack. This work presents FLOWER, a comprehensive compiler infrastructure that provides automatic canonical transformations for high-level synthesis from a domain-specific library.

3. [A Highly Configurable High-Level Synthesis Functional Pattern Library](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ELECTRONICS10050532) by Lan Huang, Teng Gao, Dalin Li, Z. Wang, Kangping Wang. This paper proposes a set of functional patterns libraries based on the MapReduce model, implemented by C++ templates, which can quickly implement high-performance parallel pipelined computing models on FPGA with specified simple parameters.

4. [AEx: Automated High-Level Synthesis of Compiler Programmable Co-Processors](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11265-023-01841-3) by Alex Hirvonen, Topi Leppänen, Kari Hepola, Joonas Multanen, J. Hoozemans, P. Jääskeläinen. This paper describes the status of AEx, a novel work-in-progress HLS tool developed in the FitOptiVis ECSEL JU project. AEx is based on automated exploration of architectures using a flexible and lightweight parallel co-processor template.
